# overlay-plugin
Overlay Plugin in vanilla JavaScript

Why: I found myself needing to have a sticky button in the corner of my websites for various situations where on clicking, I want a box to appear with the rest of the page blanked out - the box could be:
* A contact form
* Text/Information
* A product to buy
* Anything else

## What it looks like


## Guide
1. Add overlay.js to your directory.
2. Add <script src="overlay.js"></script> to whatever page you want the plugin to appear.
3. Add <div class="overlay-content"></div> to your code.
4. Add anything you want in the div to display when you click the button at the bottom of your page.
