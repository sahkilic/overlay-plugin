# overlay-plugin

Overlay Plugin in vanilla JavaScript

Why: I found myself needing to have a sticky button in the corner of my websites for various situations where on clicking, I want a box to appear with the rest of the page blanked out - the box could be:

- A contact form
- Text/Information
- A product to buy
- Anything else

## What it looks like

[https://sahkilic.com](https://sahkilic.com) has the button and overlay plugin working on the front page.

## Guide

1. Add overlay.js to your directory.
2. Add <script src="overlay.js"></script> to whatever page you want the plugin to appear.
3. Add a div with class="overlay-content" to your code.
4. Add anything you want in the div to display when you click the button at the bottom of your page.
